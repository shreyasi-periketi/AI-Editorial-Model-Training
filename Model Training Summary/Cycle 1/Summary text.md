# Cycle 1

### documents
- [base_test_01]
- [caucasian_test_01]

### process

we reviewed the latest model from the last quarter, including the training images and captions. We observed that last quarter, training images were generated by prompting the SD-XL model with explicit gender and ethnicities in the prompt, and different numbers of training images were used to train `worker v5 LoRA` We then tested the base model with a baseline test (see [here](https://www.notion.so/base_test_01-9d113129d5114ed89792c0d30520da0f?pvs=21)) and a test were we explicitly prompted for Caucasian representations.

### takeaway

We observed for  `worker v5 LoRA` , the model did improve somewhat in terms of gender representation for some categories of work, but barely improved race and ethnicity diversity. We decided we wanted to focus on tackling one aspect of diversity (gender) in the next iteration of LoRA training.
